Visit Lakes Contributions

Zafar: Added data from Vivianâ€™s previous CSS Challenge project, Visit Lakes, to an object list in the file data.js. Created multiple branches (including data_file, js-functionality, add-new-lake, styling) of which all were merged to master. Created concise code on the script.js file that allows users to delete and add new lakes (along with their description and image).

Vivian: Created multiple branches, (JS_Functionality, JS_DisplayList, user-input-forms, user-input-forms-take-2, style-new-lakes). Tried using the DOM to fetch and create items, however, Zafar and I agreed that his JS functions were much more clean and concise. The only branch that was pushed to the master was style-new-lakes.
