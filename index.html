          <h3>Germany's Great Lakes</h3>
          <p>
            Did you know that there are <strong>over 12,000 lakes</strong> in
            Germany?
          </p>
          <p>
            Lakes are popular amongst hikers, swimmers, locals and tourists
            alike who enjoy cooling off in their chilly water or simply stopping
            to take in their natural beauty.

            Not all of Germany's lakes are alike, with some vast lakes surrounded by
            vivid greenery, while others have stunning backdrops of snow-capped
            mountains.
